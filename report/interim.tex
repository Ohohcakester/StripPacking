\section{The Strip Packing Problem}
In the Strip Packing problem, we are given an infinitely tall strip, of maximum width $W$, and a set of $n$ rectangles $s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n$, each represented by a tuple $s_i = (w_i,h_i)$, representing the width and height of each rectangle.\\
\\
The task is to pack all of the $n$ rectangles into the strip, so that none of the rectangles overlap, and such that the total height of the strip is minimised.\\
